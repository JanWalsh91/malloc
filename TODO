- use mmap and munmap to allocate and unallocate memory.
- limit use of mmap and munmap
- pre allocate memory zones for 'small' and 'medium' mallocs
- size of zones must be a multiple of getpagesize()
- each zone must conatain at least 100 allocations
- TINY mallocs from 1 to n bytes are stored in zones of N bytes.
- SMALL mallocs from (n + 1) to m bytes are stored in zones of M bytes.
- LARGE mallocs of (m + 1) or more are stores with a simple call to mmap()
- this is a library. Cammed libft_malloc_$HOSTTYPE.so
